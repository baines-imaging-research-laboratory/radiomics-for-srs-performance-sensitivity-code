CENTRAL LIBRARY Branch 2019a Master 

Development notes as of August 29. 2019
Author: Carol Johnson

Folder CentralLibraryV1 :
		This folder held an experimental version of the Central Library that was 'function-based'.
		The version control platform used for version 1 of the library was Mercurial. All files and 
		version control history was transferred into the Git platform and stored in this folder.
		
		The first commit for branch 2019a-master deletes this folder since it is not set up for 
		compatibility with Matlab 2019a.

		
Branches : 2017a-master & 2017a-dev
		Development for the Central Library in a 'class-based' format began and can be found in
		branches 2017a-dev and its sub-branches.
		There are no further commits on the 2017a-master branch since there are no experimental versions
		of the Central Library using the Matlab v2017a.

		
Current branch : 2019a-master
			This new branch will hold the experimental versions of the Central Library (class-based)
			compatible with Matlab v2019a.
			
NOTE:
	Installation of the newer version of Matlab on the parallel server (or DCS) may be v2019a or v2019b
	depending on its release date. The 2019a branches may be renamed to 2019b.
